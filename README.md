# neuroevolution
This is a blazing fast library for people who are intersted in the classic neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT)
However, please note that it is a personally modified and optimized version for NEAT so one cannot expect that it works the same
way as the original NEAT.
NEAT as implemented in this library was able to beat the original NEAT as described in the paper: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

The usage of this library is to be updated later.
